## Initial Commit (22.04.2018)
  - Added Xcode standard files for a "Tabbed App" (app that uses a tab controller, which we need) to our project. 
  - The Project has the working title "Therapy Helper", and has my personal account as the team. We'll need to figure out how we can get a "team designation", I suppose.
